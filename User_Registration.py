        Registers a new user.
        
        This function takes an email, password, and password confirmation as input. It performs a series of checks to ensure the registration 
        is valid:
        - Verifies that the email is in a valid format.
        - Ensures that the password matches the confirmation password.
        - Validates that the password meets the strength requirements.
        - Checks if the email is already registered.
        
        If all checks pass, the user is registered, and their email and password are stored in the `users` dictionary, along with a confirmation 
        status set to False (indicating the user is not yet confirmed). A success message is returned.

        Args:
            email (str): The user's email address.

        Returns:
